## 1 Inception of Layout - CMOS Fabrication Process
16-Mask CMOS Process

i) Selecting a substrate with suitable properties
ii) Creating Active Region for the transistors
iii) N-Well and P-Well Formation
iv) Formation of Gate
v) Lightly-Doped Drain (LDD) Formation
vi) Source and Drain Formation
vii) Formation of Contacts and Local Interconnects
viii) Formation of Higher Level Metal Layers 

## 1.1 Selecting a substrate with suitable properties
- P-type substrate with high resistivity (5~50ohms)
- Orientation (100)
- Substrate doping should be less than the well doping

## 1.2 Creating Active Region for the transistors
- ~ 1um photoresist
- ~ 80nm of Si₃N₄
- ~ 40nm of SiO₂
- Washed out in developing solution Si₃N₄ etched.
- Resist chemically removed
- Placed in oxidation furnance
- Field oxide is grown this process is called "Locos" (Local Oxidation of Silicon)
- Si₃N₄ stripped using hot phosphoric acid

## 1.3 N-well and P-well Formation
- Ion-implantation is used to further change the channel doping to adjust the threshold voltage, as required.

## 1.4 Formation of Gate

## 1.5 Lightly-Doped Drain (LDD) Formation
- LDD is formed to prevent hot electron effect and short channel effects.
  PMOS Doping profile: P+, P-, N
  NMOS doping profile: N+, N-, P
Two reasons for this
- Hot electron effect - Electric Field E = v/d High energy carriers break Si-Si bonds 3.2ev barrier between Si conduction band.
- Short channel effect - for short channel drain field penerates channel.

## 1.6 Source and Drain Formation

## 1.7 Formation of Contacts and Local Interconnects

## 1.8 Formation of Higher Level Metal Layers

## 1.9 Final Wafer after Fabrication
